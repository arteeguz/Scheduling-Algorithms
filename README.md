# Scheduling Algorithms Performance Comparison

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and comparison of two fundamental scheduling algorithms: First Come First Serve (FCFS) and Round Robin (RR). Using a blend of C++ for algorithm implementation and Python for data visualization, this project offers insightful metrics on the performance of these algorithms.

## Features

- **C++ Implementation**: Core scheduling algorithms implemented in C++ for efficient computation.
- **Python Analysis**: Python scripts for parsing output data and generating CSV files for analysis.
- **Streamlit Visualization**: An interactive Streamlit application to visualize the performance metrics of the algorithms.
- **Comparison Metrics**: Analysis includes Total Time, Average Turnaround Time (TAT), Average Waiting Time, and CPU Efficiency.

## How to Run

1. **C++ Program**: Compile and run the C++ program to generate output data.
2. **Python CSV Generator**: Execute the Python script to convert the output data into a CSV file.
3. **Streamlit Application**: Run the Streamlit app to visualize and compare the performance of the algorithms.

## Visualization

The Streamlit app presents the data through intuitive bar charts, offering a clear comparison between FCFS and RR algorithms. Metrics are annotated for quick understanding.
